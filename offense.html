<p> <h1>Downs</h1>
Downs are the most fundamental part of NFL play. The offensive team moves the ball forward in sections of at least 10 yards. They have four chances (or downs) to gain those 10 yards. Each time the ball is advanced at least 10 yards within their four chances, another first down is earned, with four more chances to go a further 10 yards.
If the offensive team fails to move 10 yards within four downs, possession is surrendered. However, the ball is usually punted to the defending team on fourth down.
<br>In football there are a few ways to score. <h1>Scoring</h1>Most of the scoring is done by field goals and touchdowns. Here is a list of the types of scores possible:
<br>Touchdown - 6 points
<br>Extra point - 1 point
<br>Two point conversion - 2 points
<br>Field Goal - 3 points
<br>Safety - 2 points
<br>More details on football scoring: 

Touchdown - 6 points 
<br>
Touchdowns are the primary goal in football and they score the most points. Players score a touchdown when they advance the ball across the other team's goal line into the end zone. Players must have possession of the football and it must "break the plane" of the goal line. Once the ball has broken the plane on a run, then a touchdown is scored and what happens afterwards doesn't matter. 
<br>
After scoring a touchdown the offensive football team is also awarded the chance for an extra point or two point conversion. 
<br>
Extra point - 1 point 
<br>
An extra point can be attempted after a touchdown. The ball is placed on the 2 yard line (NFL) or 3 yard line (college) and the team attempts a play to kick the ball through the uprights. If they make it, they get 1 point. This is sometimes called a PAT or Point After Touchdown. 
<br>
Two point conversion - 2 points 
<br>
A two point conversion can be attempted after a touchdown. Like with the extra point, the ball is placed on the 2 yard line (NFL) or 3 yard line (college). In this case the team tries to advance the ball across the goal line like with a touchdown. They get 1 attempt. If they can advance the football across the goal, they get 2 points. 
<br>
This is considered more difficult and risky versus the extra point. Most teams attempt the extra point until late in the game. If they really need 2 points, then they will take the chance. 
<br>
Field Goal - 3 points 
<br>
A field goal is when the place kicker kicks the ball through the uprights. It can be attempted at any time, but is usually attempted on fourth down with the football inside the opponent's 35 yard line. 
<br>
In order to figure the length of a field goal, you have to add 10 yards for the distance of the End Zone and another 7 yards for the snap of the ball back to the holder to the line of scrimmage. This means you add 17 yards to the line of scrimmage marker to get the field goal length. For example, if the football is on the 30 yard line, it would be a 47 yard field goal attempt. 
<br>
Safety - 2 points 
<br>
A safety occurs when the defense tackles an offensive player behind their goal line. A safety is also awarded if a dropped or blocked punt goes through the kicking team's end zone. Sometimes a safety is awarded in the case of a penalty on the offensive football team in the end zone such as holding. 
<br>
<h1>Referee Signals for Scoring </h1>
<br>
Touchdown signal
<br>

To signal a touchdown, extra point, two point conversion, and field goal, the referee raises both arms straight into the air. Touchdown!

<br>
Safety Signal
<br>

To signal a safety, the referee puts his palms together above his head. 
Football players tend to be specialized in their roles on the team, especially offensive football players. Some players have managed to play multiple positions on offense and defense even at the professional level, but this rarely happens.


<h1>Football player positions on the offense:</h1><br> Offensive Line: The heart of the football offense is made up of the offensive line. The main job of the offensive line is to block for the quarterback and running backs. This sounds simple, but offensive linemen must be prepared for all sorts of stunts and tricks thrown at them from the defense. They must also be able to stand and block for a pass play (pass blocking) or push the defense a certain way to create holes for a run play (run blocking). Offensive linemen run plays and move blocks around to fool the defense in order to keep defenders off of the players with the football. Offensive linemen tend to be big and strong. Without a strong offensive line, the rest of the football team will struggle.
Football Quarterback Position

<br>
There are five positions that make up the offensive line: 
<br>
The center - In the middle of the offensive line, the center snaps the football to the quarterback. 
<br>
Right and left Guard - these are the two offensive linemen on either side of the center. 
<br>
Right and left Tackle - the two offensive linemen next to the guards. 
<br>
Tight end: The tight ends line up just outside the Tackles. A football team may have one, two, or no tight ends in the game at a given time. Tight ends are combination offensive linemen and receivers. They often help block just like the O-line, but they also go out for passes. Tight ends need to be big, strong, fast, and have good hands. 
<br>
Wide Receivers: These football players line up on or near the line of scrimmage, but usually far away from where the ball is placed. These players main job is to get open and catch passes. The main skill of wide receivers is the ability to catch the football and speed. Some wide receivers are small and exceptionally fast, while other wide receivers are fast, but taller and use their size and height to catch the football over defenders.

<br>
Running Backs: These football players line up in the backfield. Their main job is to carry the football, but running backs also need to block during pass plays. Full backs are a type of running back whose main job is to block. They usually run in front and block for another running back that is carrying the football. Running backs are usually strong, fast, and able to see the field and quickly cut toward openings in the defense. Running backs also are receivers and often catch several passes during a football game. 
<br>
Quarterback: The quarterback is the player who gets the ball from the center and runs the play. The quarterback may run with the ball, hand it off to a running back, or pass the football to a receiver. Quarterbacks need to be good passers, be able to see the field, read the defense, and make good decisions quickly.
