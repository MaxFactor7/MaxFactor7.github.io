		<h1>Football player positions on the special teams: </h1>
<br>
Special teams is an oft overlooked, but very important part of winning football games. Special teams play on kick-offs, punts, extra points, and field goals. 
<br>
Punter: The punter is the kicker who kicks punts. A good punt will be long and high to allow for the tacklers to get downfield. A good punter will also be able to control his distance and to stop the ball inside the 20 yard line. 
<br>
Field Goal kicker: This player kicks field goals and extra points. Accuracy is key here. This football player usually kicks the kick-off as well where distance is the main goal. 
<br>
Place Holder: The player that holds the ball for the field goal kicker. 
<br>
Long Snapper: The center who snaps the ball to the punter. This is a special skill and is often not the same player as the center.
