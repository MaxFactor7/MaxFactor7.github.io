		<h1>Football player positions on the defense: </h1>

Football teams run all sorts of defensive schemes and formations. Defensive players must be able to react to the offense and play both the run and the pass. On any given play, a defender may have a different job, but we will describe the typical positions and defensive football players. 
<br>
Defensive Line: The make up of the defensive line can change from football team to football team as well as from play to play. The defensive line plays at the line of scrimmage just opposite the offensive line. Their main job is to stop the surge of the offensive linemen on a rushing play and to get to the passer on a pass play. There are usually three to five players on a defensive line including: 
<br>
Nose Guard: A defensive lineman that plays at the center of the D-line right at the ball. The nose guard is a big, strong player who can clog up the middle and make it hard for the offensive team to run the ball. 
<br>
Defensive Tackles: Similar to the nose guard (or instead of the nose guard), these football players are the inside force of the defensive line. 
<br>
Defensive Ends: These football players play outside the tackles. Their main job is to rush the passer and to keep any rushing plays contained from getting outside. These players are big and strong, but also fast so they can get around the outside and to the quarterback. 
<br>
Linebackers: The linebackers make up the next line of defense. Linebackers are usually the main tacklers on the defense. They plug holes in the defensive line when rushers try to get through. They also do some pass coverage of running backs and tight ends. Some teams use three linebackers and some four. There is usually a middle linebacker who calls out defensive formations and plays depending on the offensive set up. Linebackers must be fast and good tacklers.
<br>

Cornerbacks: These football players cover the wide receivers and try to prevent them from catching a pass. They also help out on run plays that get passed the linebackers. 
<br>
Safety: Safeties are there to prevent the big play. At least one safety tries to stay behind the wide receivers if they should pass the cornerbacks. Safeties also help the linebackers out on run plays.
